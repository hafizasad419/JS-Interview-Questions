## 5. Accessing Object Properties

Shows different ways of accessing object properties, including using a variable for the key.

## 6. Object References and Cloning

Highlights the importance of understanding object references and introduces ways to clone objects.

## 7. Type Comparison and Strict Equality

Discusses type comparison using `==` and `===` operators.

## 8. Class, Static Method, and Constructor (Pending)

Pending section for more advanced topics related to classes and static methods.

## 9. Variable Declaration and Typo
